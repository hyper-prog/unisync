UniSync

 UniSync is an open-source File synchronization 
 program for Linux and Windows. It is an open source utility 
 for efficiently comparing or synchronizing large
 directory structures by checking names and sizes or optionally
 the times or even the contents by hashes. (Md5 or Sha-2)
 The UniSync can even synchronize offline directories 
 (Which are not available same time) by creating a catalog file
 and making and update package according to that.

 The UniSync has a graphical user interface names UniSyncGui.
